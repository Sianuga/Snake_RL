# Snake_RL

This project focused on creating Deep QLearning algorithm for popular game Snake. Snake game was created in Pygame and I used Pytorch for creation of neuron network. 
After 200 hundred games the agent could achieve score of 56, by developing squre-shaped pattern of movement, probably because of limitations on its ability to perceive 
the environment, as the agent does not know position of its body but only the head.
